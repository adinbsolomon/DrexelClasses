# POSH
Drexel Plan of Study Helper

Dexel University doesn't have great access to resources for students
trying to plan out their graduation, so this seeks to fill that need

The term master schedule - the schedule of courses offered in each
quarter  of the current and previous years - is terribly oranized,
and the course  catalog is difficult to navigate given the advert-
isement  of courses no longer offered. The primary goal of POSH is
to centralize these two poorly-managed resources into a useful and
easy-to-navigate centralized data structure.

Before you can do any of the webscraping (built on selenium so less
experienced users can see what's going on),  you'll need to install
the chrome (only supported browser right now) driver from
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
I strongly recommend updating chrome so you can get the latest
driver!
