TODO
    - Allow for additions to already-fetched data?
    - It would be neat to have unit tests
    - Initialize the database!
    - Figure out a way to represent the schedules/POSs/requirements/agendas/etc.
        - Each POS is subject to a set of requirements, and each requirement
          could have a agenda - a way to meet that requirement - that could easily
          be represented visually. For example, if I need to take 2 CS tracks,
          one agenda could be the AI and Theory tracks, and another could be the AI
          and DSnA tracks. Each of those agendas could have a bunch of resolutions
          associated with them which are they ways in which the agendas could be
          realized.
            - This plan just submits to a computational nightmare, though some
              optimization and background processes could mask most of it,
              especially if the processing is broken down into agendas... The
              alternative to breaking down the search is to do some integer
              programming or some other efficient SAT solver
        - We could do a whole bunch of computer algebra to represent requirements
          like they're represented in prerequisites for courses and also on
          DegreeWorks
