Hello!

1b

host, connection, dnt, accept, referer, cookie

1c

GET

1d

connection, content length, keep alive

1e

200, meaning a successful GET

1f

the font of 'Hello!' changed because instead of rendering plaintext, it rendered text as html using the default font

1g

this is because the request handler serves the same response regardless of the url in the request

2a

a) Hello!
b) (on the next lines)
I got a request!
Request URL: /
Request headers: { host: '127.0.0.1:3000', 'user-agent': 'curl/7.78.0', accept: '*/*' }
Request method: GET

2b

curl only has host and accept headers. the user-agent also specified curl instead of a browser

2c

The output from curl in verbose mode is very similar to the information presented in the network tab. This is because the server doesn't differentiate between requests varying in the ways that these requests do.

2d

curl returns the text of the html that was sent over
the browser renders the html the way browsers do
