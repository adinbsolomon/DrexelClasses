# CS-615-Final

### Outline
This is the contributors' final project for Drexel's CS 615, Deep Learning, taught by Professor Matt Burlick. The project focuses on applying transfer learning to a GAN trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten numbers for use in generating EMNIST handwritten english letters.

### To-Do
- [x] Find and Preprocess Data
- [x] Organize Framework Codebase
- [ ] Evaluate Available GANs Trained on MNIST
- [x] Train GANs from Scratch on EMNIST
- [ ] Use EMNIST in Applying Transfer Learning to MNIST GANs
- [ ] Gather Data!
