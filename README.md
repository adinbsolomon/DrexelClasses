# DrexelClasses

This repository serves as a public display of my coursework for prospective employers and anyone else interested in the material.

<b>PLEASE</b> do not attempt to re-use this material for your own Drexel classes. I'm more than happy to set up a half-hour call with you to discuss your assignments instead. I am incredibly honored to have studied with my professors and know that their assignments cultivate valuable experience in their students --> Please don't cheat!

## Courses

| Course Name | Course Description |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
|  SE 575: Advanced Software Engineering | Study and application of design patterns to various case studies in Java. |
| CS 615: Deep Learning | Development of a Deep Learning framework and application to a variety of challenges using Python. |
| CS 375: Web Development | Basic web development focused on Java/HTML/CSS. This includes assignments with Node and Express, exploration of public APIs, and a final project - mine was a webapp for visualizing the Implied Volatility Surface of Options Contracts using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) |
| CS 660: Data Analysis at Scale with GCS | Studying and applying the MapReduce framework for large-scale data processing tasks with Python and the Google Cloud System. |

Unfortunately not all of my coursework is in this repo just yet - this repo is primarily supplemental to my portfolio - because I have to track down my work in multiple places. My operating system got corrupted during my 3rd year at Drexel, and some of my work wasn't backed up yet! If you're interested in any of my work that isn't here yet, please reach out, and I'll put my work up ASAP. Thank you for your patience.
